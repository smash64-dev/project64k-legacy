Cheat26="Beta Bottles Revenge Mode",801255C2 0001,80080881 0002
Cheat26_N=Bottles Revenge is a Beta mode from Banjo Tooie that the RWP team recently uncovered after an extraordinary amount of effort. Bottles the Spirit transforms into Bottles the Devil and posses enemies nearby and allows a second player hooked up to Pad 2 to play as that Posses character to try to foil Banjos Plans. As player one goes about its business, player two uses every enemy nearby to try to nab Banjo and take away some life. This mode is incredible, and you can control almost every enemy in the game: slot machines, flying creatures, uggers, zubbas...and this is just the beginning. (Congrats Rare Witch Project)

Cheat226_N=This code, made by TS_Death_Angel in early/mid 2006, emulates the second interface utilized by Ocarina of Time, where there only the C and A buttons are visible. There are textures which were created for use with this code (will upload later), and you can get them here.

Cheat227_N=Hold Z, and then press L + R to bring up level select anywhere while playing. As stated previously, enabling the map select in 1.0 was thought to be an impossible feat. Standard OoT's map select has 115 maps, none of which are beta. It also has two N64DD test maps, the first test requires a 64DD under N64, game loads Ura Zelda disk. The second doesn't work.

Cheat61="Activators Codes\Press R\For Appear in Strange Places (Hold R)",D01C84B5 0010,8111B936 0001
Cheat61_N=If you go to an area where Link is immobile or invisible, using the "appear in strange places" code will almost always fix it, but you'll start somewhere outside of the Arena and in air. I recommend using the infinite step Hover boots code already supplied with PJ64 so you can float back into the arena in the event that this happens.
Cheat62="Beta\Interface always Off/On",8011B4B9 00FF,8011B92F 00??
Cheat62_N=If you go to an area where the interface is accessible, this signigfies that you're not in 'beta' mode anymore. Using the "interface always off/on" code, you can stay in 'beta' mode regardless of what happens. This may cause more crashes in SOME areas, but it's rare and is not too severe. If you need to explore a beta area with the interface, "use the interface always on" portion of the code. Don't use the codes as you start the game. If you need the interface on/off at a specific time, start the game, go to the area, activate the code, keep it on until next reset.

Cheat61_N=If you go to an area where Link is immobile or invisible, using the "appear in strange places" code will almost always fix it, but you'll start somewhere outside of the Arena and in air.

Cheat62_O=$5A Off,$59 On
Cheat62_N=If you go to an area where the interface is accessible, this signigfies that you're not in 'beta' mode anymore. Using the "interface always off/on" code, you can stay in 'beta' mode regardless of what happens. This may cause more crashes in SOME areas, but it's rare and is not too severe. If you need to explore a beta area with the interface, "use the interface always on" portion of the code. Don't use the codes as you start the game. If you need the interface on/off at a specific time, start the game, go to the area, activate the code, keep it on until next reset.

If you need to explore a beta area with the interface, "use the interface always on" portion of the code. Don't use the codes as you start the game.

Cheat30="Main Codes\Bulldozer Can Drive Through Anything",813EE688 0101
Cheat30_N=Taking another look at these Drive Through Anything codes, I realized something. They're actually Deceleration MOdifiers. The default value is like FF4C (which the game interpret as negative somethin), so when it's made a positive number, it causes you to launch forward through things instead of stopping.

Cheat39_N=This is the coolest Blast Corps code I've seen so far. It's not really a new vehicle, but it's the ballista, it just handels differently. It's always doing 360's and spining around. You destroy buildings by shooting them OR running into them. Very fun.

Cheat59="Moon Jumps\Player 1",D0027065 0020,50006F80 0000,810A3E6C 4192
Cheat59_N=First, you need a Cheat Device Pro and a 4-megabyte RAM Pak. This code will let you moon jump almost anything, bombs, enemies, power-ups, Bombermen, etc. These codes are awesome to use in multi. VERY IMPORTANT: For these to work, the "object" that you want to "moon jump" must first bounce, and then hold down L. Examples: throwing a bomb, enemy, etc. To moon jump bomberman, you must also bounce. One way to do this is the bomb jump technique (get on a ledge, drop a bomb, fall and bounce off the bomb). Why is it 100 codes long? When ever you enter or exit a stage, or part of a stage, the one code that controls Bomberman changes, and won't work on the next level. This is the only way for them to work. One more note, these codes work 98% of the time, freeze free. If you have tried and can't moon jump in a certain level, just re-enter that area. These codes can be much longer, but these are the most popular base codes.

Cheat23_N=For Multiplayer, Intro to Cock & Plucker and Adventure mode, not only will the sprite change, but it will give you the same benefits as the character. However, the characters don't move their mouths in cut-scenes as expected. These codes always let you be the character code you put in, in all part of the game, except the ending cutscene in Heist. Also, going in certain cutscenes as certain characters may freeze the game (high chance, but only with the cutscene with the character you are modified as, such as Sarge meeting Sarge, automatic freeze). When the same name is repeated, it just means that their is another look of the character. Thanks to Macman & Coolboyman

Cheat2_N=If you activate this on a level surface, then you will go down under the road, and it will freeze after about 4 seconds. If you let go before it freezes, it zaps you back to the road. While you are on a ramp, hold R (I am fully aware that this is the brake, it has to be the brake) and you will go up while the car veers to the left (not effecting the direction it is traveling). To have even more fun, hit a car and flip. Then on a ramp, hold R and you will flip until you let go. Don't use the 'Skidding Brakes' and 'Moon Jump' together.

Cheat79_N=This is similar to the first rapid fire code, but this one will allow you to use all weapons. The other code will not let you fire the BFG 9000 or the Rocket Launcher, and this one does. It is also just a little bit slower. Thanks to Spud Boy

Cheat378_N=Increases the speed of gameplay and is useful during multiplay on levels that suffer from slow down.
Cheat360_N=When you activate the jetpack you "teleport" high up and then fall way down. Lovely.
Cheat361_N=Whenever you activate the jetpack you immediately die! Probably has something to do with clipping problems.
Cheat363_N=When you activate the jetpack you go all the way up.
Cheat364_N=When you jump, you jump to the highest point you can go, then you slowly fall back to earth. I have yet to test it with an activator, though.
Cheat365_N=If you rapidly press C-Up and C-Down, you will instantly surface if you are underwater, or instantly jump up to the celing if you're out of the water.
Cheat374_N=Most enemies do not move or shoot, but some do. This code freezes most sprites too (explosions, fire, etc.). Also, it only works in Singleplayer mode.
Cheat375_N=This code works on all difficulties, but doesn't work on the clone battlelords.Another thing I learned is that each alien on a level has its own health address. Also found out how much damage certain guns do, for example the pistol does random damage from 4-10, explosive shotgun shells do 75 points, etc. But back to the Battlelord code cause I think it is interesting. The first line of code in the memory editor starts at 09 then works its way down to 00 this represents how many times B.L. must have his life points worn down, think of it as his "remaining lives". I found this out cause when I used the second code line in the gs with 0000 I still had to shoot B.L. 10 times to kill him. The second line of code is how many hit points it takes to make him lose a digit from the first line. I believe he starts at 200. So I am pretty sure B.L. has 2,000 hitpoints. Heres where I was puzzled though and that is at the third line. I am not really sure what it does but I do know that if you enter the other two at 0000 and leave out the third code it still takes a whole crapload of hits to kill B.L.This number starts at 255 and goes down with each successive hit on B.L.,however it too cycles, restarting at 255(at least I assume it does, because it went from 255 to 6 to 14, and that was from me checking every couple of shots) I beleive this set of digits is also connected to B.L.'s hit points, but how I do not know. All I know is if the last four digits of the codes are reduced to Zero he dies in 1 hit. I am also not sure how i was able to make the first 2 codes work in the ten hits kills part without the third line entered. I will continue to test the code and try to learn more. I am also going to look for Overlords and Zeros health addresses. This could open up a new challenge; make Zero with infinite health and see how long you can last against him starting with the pistol and working your way through all of the weapons.

Cheat177_N=There Are Bumps/Jumps/Holes In Tracks. Be very careful! There are invisible holes on the tracks, (mainly on corners and crazy amounts of bumps) and there are bumps try to avoid or slow down.
Cheat178="Alter Tracks\Track Cofuser",8109EACF 30C5

Cheat179="Miscellanious Codes\Finish Camera In Time Trials",880CD003 0002
Cheat179_N=Steps to getting the demo mode in time trial: 1. Make sure 2 controllers are connected. 2. Play game and go to Grand Prix/Practice 3. Press the Cheat Device Button in the car select menu. A secound car will be active. Use the 2nd controller to select it. 4. Enter race/then quit race. 5. Go to Time Trial, select your car and track, and then enter the race. Press F9 before countdown starts.

Cheat182="Alter Tracks\Track Changer 1",8109E5A4 30C5
Cheat182_N=This code adds twists/turns to existing twist/turns/loops (Mute City's loop is now corkscrewed). For some tracks, you may have to start then select retry because you go through the track the first time. The starting points are changed a bit, and the starting grid is bigger/smaller. Some tracks have a flip point (Silence 1) that won't let you drive the whole track. In some cases it may freeze. The best method to tackling the loop twists is to slow down and hold up!
Cheat183="Alter Tracks\Track Changer 2",8109E5A8 30C5
Cheat183_N=See the note for the first track changer for additional details. The cars won't fall through the track, and twists or turns are different. In Sector A, there is an inverted loop/corkscrew! That may look impossible to drive on, but just drive carefully. This code seems to be more crash-prone than the previous code, especially on Red Canyon 1. Silence is still the only track with a flip point that you can't drive through. Rainbow Road is awesome, with the bombs gathered together!

Cheat124_N=When a person is shot, two things happen to the body - besides damage and blood stains. There is a spark and some smoke. Shoot somebody in the game and you'll see a large spark appear where the bullet hit. Not only that, but you may also notice a bit of smoke rise off of the wound. These characters aren't supposed to be made of metal, are they? No, they are meant to be flesh and blood. Just as Rare intended them to be. The value for the spark is 01, where as the smoke is 03. So, just what might the 02 value be for? Blood. Yes, blood is still locked away in the game, never to be seen by any gamers. That is until I started poking around in the Memory Editor. However, by simply changing either the spark or the smoke and making it into blood, the splatter is way too big. This meant that I had to modify the size of it. The values for the size differs for both spark and smoke, and is larger or smaller for each area of the body. I've made an entire list of each part of the anatomy, listing the type and sizes for each part effected. I'll post that later. But for now, here is the current code I'm using.

Cheat140_N=An example is 02, which is the Facility level. Select the Dam (or any level that you would prefer) and beat that level. Depending on which digit you entered in, you've beaten that level. Some of these digits occasionally let you play the level that you put in, so beware! You can also get cheats under the 'Cheat Options' this way! An asterik placed infront of a digit means that it will freeze your game, while two asteriks mean that you may occasionally play that level instead of the one that you choose!

Cheat143_N=This code gives you all of the levels, (including the secret ones) all of the in-game cheats, and the special 007 mode! Yes, you must insert all of these codes. Also, you must insert the codes from left to right. -- Detailed Instructions Of Use: -- Here's what you do. First, without using your Cheat Device, fill up all of the files so that there aren't any free ones. Then DELETE THE 2ND FILE ONLY (the second savegame file from the left-hand side), turn off your N64, put in the Cheat Device, and turn on the code above. The second file shouldn't be empty, it should be named "007". If it isn't, look for another one named "007". If you don't find anything, go to the empty file and play on the Dam. "Agent" mode would be the wisest choice. Beat that level, and get through the screen that shows your time, your weapon of choice, etc. Hit the "B" button until you come to the place where you choose your level. EVERY SINGLE ONE SHOULD BE THERE. Hit "B" again and check out your cheats file. ALL 23 SHOULD BE THERE. When you pick your stage, you will see another difficulty level, "007". This is the level editor, where you can change all kinds of stuff!

Cheat29_N=As we all know, the Facility level in multiplayer only consists of half the entire level. There just happens to be a locked door at the end of the long, grey hallway. We can get past that door with multiple codes with a GameShark� - 1: Walk Through Doors (just casually walk through the locked door) - 2: Destroy Almost Anything with GS� button (blow up the door) - 3: Unlock it (the door is now able to open). If you go back into the "back zone" area, you will notice that there is nothing to be found. Just empty rooms everywhere, not much fun. Using the codes for my custom Facility level, you will actually start in the back zone. All 8 respawns are located in the bz, none within the original levels playable area. I have also changed the locations of the doors and glass so that they fill in every space needed to be correct. All the glass is see throughable, has the ability to be shot through and also can now be broken. Each door is operational, except for one which I decided to lock. The locked door is almost the same as the original locked door, it is actually the one infront of it. This way you cannot enter back into the original level, like you could not enter into the new bz area before. I moved each and every weapon, armour and even the flag into the back zone to make it complete. For fun, I even through in a music modifier so that you can battle it out to the "surrounded" theme which occurs at the end of the Facility mission. For pics of the level being played in 2-Player mode, check out my website: www.geocities.com/themultiplayersaviours . You can also watch a video of the "Fac bz" on the NGPA website (National GoldenEye Players Association) at www.goldeneyeforever.com . Just click on the "footage" section to find the fully detailed walk through located at the top of the page. NOTE: You must use all the codes listed under a certain amount of players to play the whole level. You must also only use one player mode at a time and play the Facility level only, or else the game will freeze. If you are using the Code Generator, you may turn the codes off and play another level without fear of the game freezing. Just turn the codes back on to play the Facility Back Zone level again. I also strongly recommend you use a GameShark� version 3.3, the 3.2 doesn't seem to be able to use all the codes for the level correctly. You can upgrade your 3.2 to a 3.3 by using the Nintendo Utilities found at GameShark.com . Try out the level, it is worth the time to enter into your GS� (even though it may take awhile if you don't use the 'cut and paste' method and simply upload the codes to your GameShark�). I hope you have fun with my customized level, everyone who has played it has enjoyed it so far. Let's see if you do too. Don York a.k.a Wreck7. Good luck and God speed! Thanks to Wreck7

Cheat80_N=Krijy made a push-button code modifier. It changes the invincible code into something else. There were alot of codes in the game that didn't have button sequences assigned to them. The are three that do have buttons assigned to them, but I don't know what they do. We should check the unknown ones to see what they do. Who knows what we might unlock? Thanks to Krijy

Cheat81_N=A code to make the autoaim not shoot at your teammates ("Teammates? What teammates?" Um, yeah, teammates...I'll keep that a surprise for now :3) or the cell switches in S.S. Anubis (unless the switch has yet to be shot). Yes, 1080 degree autoaim, but it tends to have better luck locking onto things in front of you, after which you can turn and face the other direction and fire at things you can't see with dead on accuracy. Works great with a rapid fire sniper rifle. Of which I have. Thanks so much by Zeld

Cheat88_N=And now for the best part of my JFG hacking. I was able to bring the start menu of single player into multiplayer, which allows you to access the MAP menu and select a single player level. This effectively means 4 PLAYER CO OP MODE, of which there are tons of pictures of on my photobucket. :3 This code could use some work, though. Where "?" is the number of players you will be playing with. Most of that code is just there to disable the split screen when in single player mode. In Co Op mode, entering a single player level will turn off the split screen, so you have to force it to stay on or else the other players will be playing but unable to see what they're doing XD. Now, lots of Co Op mode bugs and issues revolve around the odd spawn points for the unaccounted players. Players 2, 3, and 4 have no business being in story mode, so the game just kinda puts them places. Well, here's a code that will fix that by warping them to wherever player 1 is, and facing the same direction, once player 1 presses L and R. No wait. I just remembered. This code was merged into the same hook as the Multiplayer "Uber" Code, so scroll back up to that and you'll see that the code is so long because it dumps the pointers dynamically, makes the players uber, AND warps them to wherever player 1 is when player 1 presses L and R.

Cheat89_N=Why is it long? Because it's a completely custom save and load routine that allows you to save and load files in Co Op mode! All of your files will be completely interchangeable between single player mode and co op mode, but you may need to have at least two friends so that player 3 can load Lupus's data...Lupus tends to freeze Co Op mode because his data structure is too weird (in fact, the infinite health part of my uber code doesn't work on him, but the rest of it does :3). Here's how you use it. First, you go into the single player file load menu. You copy the file you want to load to the slot you want to save in; this selects the slot you'll be saving in and loads the data of the file into the RAM. If you want to start a new game, do this anyway, because starting a new game still requires this unless you don't care where you save. Now, press L to copy the save data that was loaded into the RAM to a new place in the expansion pak area. (Oh, by the way, all my ASM editing codes require the expansion pak. I'm just that lazy.) Press B and select multiplayer mode and get a game going with the co op menu code active. Now, either press L to load your save file, or pause and press Z to save your game, effectively starting a new file and skipping that over long intro cutscene (yay!). Because of the nature of the code, I advise resetting after saving a new game and then loading that new game file normally, because the L button will load the file you didn't want to load and overwrite your new game if you haven't pressed it while in multiplayer. It only stops overwriting after the first press, after which it starts copying multiplayer data back to save RAM. Because of this, until you load a co op game normally you won't be able to save most things. Because the code now fully loads and saves all save data and has allocated space in the save data for a fourth player, it can load and save everything now (at least, it should). As far as I can tell you can play through the whole game in co op mode, except for the rooms that still seem to freeze the game (which is every single room if someone is playing as Lupus, apparently). Certain levels like Water Ruin will spawn the extra players on top of the ship, finishing a level prematurely and preventing play. To avoid this, hold L and R with the multiplayer uber code on as the landing cutscene ends. The game won't load the screen until you release the buttons, so while you're sitting in darkness waiting for the level to load, count to like 5 before releasing L and R and it should finally load the level with all four players in player one's spawn position. "What if I want to play the Water Ruin by using the code to place all players in player one's position, but don't want to cheat by having the invincibility and rapid fire effects, etc.?" I'll work on some guide on which codes to NOP to deactivate specific parts of the code. Sure, you can disassemble the code and see the writes and nop them yourself, but you'd have to know which write is which to nop specific cheats. Thanks so much by Zeld

Cheat221_N=This code, made by Cendamos early 2006, swaps around the HUD to make it resemble the beta version of the game. This was the first of many interface codes to come.

Cheat222_N=This code, made by TS_Death_Angel in early/mid 2006, emulates the second interface utilized by Ocarina of Time, where there only the C and A buttons are visible. There are textures which were created for use with this code (will upload later), and you can get them here.

Cheat223_N=Change memory to 8 MB. Hold Z, and then press L + R to bring up level select anywhere while playing. As stated previously, enabling the map select in 1.0 was thought to be an impossible feat. Standard OoT's map select has 115 maps, none of which are beta. It also has two N64DD test maps, the first test requires a 64DD under N64, game loads Ura Zelda disk. The second doesn't work.

Cheat60="Miscellaneous Codes\Specific things lean",80025614 0001
Cheat60_N=This code will cause all items on a specific plane to lean. This is helpful for areas in which the plane causes the crash (Ex. Weird Zora's Fountain Beta Quest 01).
Cheat61="Activators Codes\Press R\For Appear in Strange Places (Hold R)",D01C84B5 0010,8111B936 0001
Cheat61_N=If you go to an area where Link is immobile or invisible, using the "appear in strange places" code will almost always fix it, but you'll start somewhere outside of the Arena and in air. I recommend using the infinite step Hover boots code already supplied with PJ64 so you can float back into the arena in the event that this happens.
Cheat62="Beta\Interface always Off/On",8011B4B9 00FF,8011B92F 00??
Cheat62_N=If you go to an area where the interface is accessible, this signigfies that you're not in 'beta' mode anymore. Using the "interface always off/on" code, you can stay in 'beta' mode regardless of what happens. This may cause more crashes in SOME areas, but it's rare and is not too severe. If you need to explore a beta area with the interface, "use the interface always on" portion of the code. Don't use the codes as you start the game. If you need the interface on/off at a specific time, start the game, go to the area, activate the code, keep it on until next reset.

Cheat6="Max\Gold Skulltulas Killed",8011A861 0064
Cheat60="Beta\Specific things lean",800257D4 0001
Cheat60_N=This code will cause all items on a specific plane to lean. This is helpful for areas in which the plane causes the crash (Ex. Weird Zora's Fountain Beta Quest World 01)
Cheat61="Beta\Appear in Strange Places (Hold R)",D01C8675 0010,8111BAF6 0001
Cheat61_N=If you go to an area where Link is immobile or invisible, using the "appear in strange places" code will almost always fix it, but you'll start somewhere outside of the Arena and in air. I recommend using the infinite step Hover boots code already supplied with PJ64 so you can float back into the arena in the event that this happens.
Cheat62="Beta\Interface always off/on",8011B679 00FF,8011BAEF 00??
Cheat62_N=If you go to an area where the interface is accessible, this signigfies that you're not in 'beta' mode anymore. Using the "interface always off/on" code, you can stay in 'beta' mode regardless of what happens. This may cause more crashes in SOME areas, but it's rare and is not too severe. If you need to explore a beta area with the interface, "use the interface always on" portion of the code. Don't use the codes as you start the game. If you need the interface on/off at a specific time, start the game, go to the area, activate the code, keep it on until next reset.

Cheat61_N=If you go to an area where Link is immobile or invisible, using the "appear in strange places" code will almost always fix it, but you'll start somewhere outside of the Arena and in air. I recommend using the infinite step Hover boots code already supplied with PJ64 so you can float back into the arena in the event that this happens.

Cheat62_N=If you go to an area where the interface is accessible, this signigfies that you're not in 'beta' mode anymore. Using the "interface always off/on" code, you can stay in 'beta' mode regardless of what happens. This may cause more crashes in SOME areas, but it's rare and is not too severe. If you need to explore a beta area with the interface, "use the interface always on" portion of the code. Don't use the codes as you start the game. If you need the interface on/off at a specific time, start the game, go to the area, activate the code, keep it on until next reset,

You accelerate to over 100 MPH almost instantly, you fall like an anvil and bounce about 7 times, going higher with each bounce, and you slide around like mad! Steering's hard tho, and forget about stopping. If you're lucky, you'll be able to slam on the brakes, let off the gas, turn sideways, and stop about a mile down the road. :p Hard to get into caves, but super fun!

Cheat232_N=This cheat is very weird and can be glitchy too in some situations. This code gives you barely any gravity. You run off a ledge and you barely go down at all. You can also drive in the air. Pressing "R" Makes you jump up and go a little higher. It is definitely worth a try.; i) Slipping on bananas does nothing except trigger the annoying noise your character makes when he is unhappy; ii) Shells mostly send you rocketing downwards. You fall in the water that isn't there and Lakitu tries to put you back on the level and fails to do so; iii) There is no power sliding; iv) The graphics for the levels in V.S. Mode get screwed up; v) If you are flying and you hit someone in the head, you will go flying upwards and never will come down; vi) If you crash into a wall at high speeds, you will start to spin like the way when you get hit by a shell and it will take a while for you to get to the ground depending on how high up you are.

Cheat245_N=You must follow some specific steps to use this code: 1) Start a Mario GP game; 2) At the character selection screen, hold L on controller 1 and choose your character. Don't release L until the cup selection screen appears; 3) Select a cup; you should start in round 1 as normal. If you start in the round you chose and there are several Marios, either you did it wrong or the code doesn't work; 4) Quit the race, select Mario GP again; 5) Select the same character again, and DO NOT hold L; 6) Select your desired cup and you should begin in the round you selected; Once you've finished (or quit) a GP race, you should be able to start another one normally (no having to hold L and quit first). This is still largely untested though. May have problems on emulators because it modifies ASM when you press L; Values 4 and up allow you to race on tracks from other cups, but I don't think you can finish the cup; By the way, instead of holding L and starting a game, you can just let the first title screen demo run, then start the game as normal. However, the game will not set up the AI characters properly; it sets them up as if you were Mario. If you select someone else, then the AI character that should be Mario will instead be the character you selected. This doesn't appear to cause any problems though. Razz Tested on a real N64.

Cheat362_N=Here's how it works. When the race starts, race normally until you get an item and it stops flashing. Then press C Left and C Right together (this can be done while paused). Now, you won't lose your item when you use it, and the item window will display even when empty. Press L to cycle through the items. Use whatever you want as much as you want! When the race ends, press L+R, or the item window will act funny in the next race; BTW, the last line sets the music level, so the code doesn't constantly change it on you. Put in a value there to use whatever level you want. Also since this uses the code for changing music level, it won't work while paused, but another player can change the item for you (which could be good or bad, hehe); Tip: Use this with my Infinite Random Items code. It'll give you an item at the start of the race, so you don't have to wait before turning the code on; Oh, and one other thing. When using the Super Mushroom, after it runs out you won't have an item but it'll still show the shroom. Just stick to normal shrooms, you have infinite anyway; BTW thanks to Parasyte and IceMario for help with the ASM.

When you serve straight, the ball goes by REALLY fast, but when he hits the ball it's sooo weak it doesn't even reach the other side, over the net!

Cheat8_N=The taunting Meat code is three seperate codes, the first being a text editor, the second being the code that activates Meats textures and the third being Shinnok's moves. Strangely enough, however you can't steal other characters' moves like Shinnok. However if you press the buttons that would normally steal them all you get is to hear that characters' name.

Cheat10_N=As with the taunting Meat code this is two separate codes, the first being a text editor and the second a move modifier (Reiko's moves). You must choose Scorpion with the red outfit, one turn of the mini pic at the select screen.

Cheat50_N=You must choose Tanya and select her 2nd costume. Three rolls of the mini pic icon at the select screen. She uses Fujins moves.
Cheat40_N=Start a 2-player match and pick your characters. At the versus screen if you choose to use Kitana simply press and hold Z. Voila, Kitana! Now after the fight if you don't want to use her anymore then don't press Z. However whenever you want to fight as her, just hit Z again!

Cheat67_N=Enter the code, then begin the game. Select the Arcade mode, and choose any character. Once the "Choose your destiny" screen pops up, choose your tower, then immediately begin hitting all the buttons so the camera doesn't zoom-in on the towers. If it does, the game will freeze. You are now Kitana!
Cheat68="Press L\For No Jump",D00F1AB1 0020,800FEA8C 0001
Cheat68_N=This code will give a veeeeeeery small jump, so small that you really don't even move.. All that happens is your feet come off the ground. Only usefulness that I've found is that if you get shot with Scorpions spear, you don't move from where you are. There might be other uses though.

Cheat103_N=(Warning: This code may cause a headache!) All effects are undone, when you do a FATALITY (It's odd to go from bright characters to their normal dark colors when you do a fatality). But it may be hard to judge where to stand if you can't see yourself if you're using code #4 (E.g. Invisible Life Bars and Characters).
Cheat104="Miscellaneous Codes\Cool Code",811A3294 00FF
Cheat104_N=This code makes the down directional button become turbo. You won't be able to uppercut anyone and sometimes you will get hit by the other player when they are not even close to you. Warning: I've found out that sometimes when you press down and right-C then the game will freeze.

Cheat111_N=The game only renders about a quarter of all the player animations its supposed to.

Cheat35_N=You can only bring Goompa out during battle, but if you do you'll be stuck with him until you reach an event where you receive a new character. It's not recommended that you use this after getting Lakilester. Goompa can't attack.
Cheat36="Have\Extra Members\Goombaria",8010F2F4 0001
Cheat36_N=The text to bring out Goombaria will be found in battle. However, if you do pick her, the game will freeze.

Cheat44="Infinite\BP",D12473EC 8223,812473EC 2403,D12473EE 0008,812473EE 7FFF
Cheat44_N=Finally, an Infinite BP code! Apparently the game doesn't keep remaining BP in memory, since all it needs to do is subtract total from all your badges. This code makes it read your total as 32,767 instead. You can change the false total by changing the last 4 digits, but keep in mind if this number minus the total BP cost of all your badges is zero or less, you still won't be able to equip any. Note also, the remaining BP display will show various crap, just ignore it. Similarly, badges you normally wouldn't have enough BP for will be grayed out, but you can equip them anyway. FInally, note the D1-codes. This game switches code in and out of the same area of memory a lot, so it's important to make sure we only modify the BP code and not some other stuff.
Cheat45="Misc. Codes\Move Available BP Display",D1248430 2483,81248430 2400
Cheat46="Misc. Codes\Disable Remaining BP Bar",D12484E0 8210,812484E0 2400

Cheat47_N=With this code you level up once per battle (assuming you get SP from it). Basically as long as you have more than 0 SP, you'll gain SP until the counter reaches 0 (you level up). Afterward, press R to set the counter to 1 so the code can work again.
Cheat37_N=Twink can't attack.
Cheat48="Have\All Badges",50007302 0001,8110F344 00E0,8110F42A 0000,D00B0ED5 0020,8010F344 0001
Cheat48_N=This will give you all the badges including some beta/unused ones. If the Badges tab disappears, unpause the game, press L, pause again, select it, go to Active Badges and back to see your badges.
Cheat49="Misc. Codes\All Badges Are Grayed Out",D12475EC 8108,812475EC 2400
Cheat49_N=All Badges Are Grayed Out, But You Can Still Equip Those You Normally Could

I tested the codes and they work. Codes were tested on my "GS" Pro V3.30. This changes the car that you use during a race. It doesn't make the game think that you have gotten the car however.

For those who don't know what Stat Exp is, there are two kinds of experience. You get normal Experience from fighting Pokemon. You also get Stat Experience depending on which Pokemon you fight. If you fight Electrodes, your Speed Stat Exp will rise more than if you fought Slowbros. If you fight Chansey, your HP Stat Exp will rise more than say, if you fought Diglett. To prove this point, take any Pokemon and fight 10-15 battles without gaining any levels. Deposit the Pokemon in the computer and take it back out, and its stats will have risen. Now use this code, deposit the Pokemon, and withdraw it again. Its stats will make a significant jump. It's not a huge jump, but each stat can rise by 20-30 points or maybe even more. After doing this, however, you can no longer get Stat Experience. (Carbos, Calcium, etc. just give your Pokemon Stat Exp). So what's so "ultimate" about this code? Simply speaking, it raises your Pokemon to its full potential. Even at Level 100, most Pokemon still have a way to go to raise their stats to the max. But with this code, you can instantly boost any Pokemon to its greatest potential!!!

Cheat6_N=Did you ever find this game just a little too hard? As if the CPU players were doing impossible things? Maybe you did, maybe you didn't. BUT THEY WERE! All along, the CPU opponents have been cheating! And now I have solid proof. Use this code: With this on, all enemy Pok�mon's moves will be Splash, Splash, Splash and Splash. You can check in a 2-player battle. Go ahead, check all Player 2's moves. Nothing but Splash. Now go into a CPU battle (best use the hardest one you can get to - Free Battle and Battle Now don't count). Fight them for a while and watch; every once in a while they'll use moves other than Splash! Even check in the Memory Editor, it still says 96 96 96 96, as in Splash Splash Splash Splash! They're using moves they don't even have! Now I wonder what The Big N will have to say about this? Think their answer will be at all related to the answer as to why my total KOs suddenly dropped to zero on Cruel Melee in SSBM? Why near-complete Pok�mon games always delete themselves? Or any other blatant cheats from over the years? Face it Nintendo, you can't hide.

Cheat308_N=There are three types of cutscenes in this game: in-game ones or ones that come before/after the level. If it is during the level then you can play the rest of that level, making this code very diverse! In some ways, this code is better than a Level Modifier because it can place you in the different stages of each level, AND also lets you view the various cutscenes in the game! If you watch a cutscene (ie. Main Menu) the one you chose in the quantity digits comes after that one. Sometimes cutscenes don't work with other ones so keep trying! Occasionally a quantity digit has two consecutive cutscenes. I have tested all of these quantity digits AFTER and BEFORE a cutscene, so if a specified cutscene doesn't show when it says that it is the right quantity digits then try something else.

Cheat337="Level Codes\Sewers of Imperial City\New Camera Angle",811A7612 42C8
Cheat337_N=The first camera angle is permanently (until, of course, your Cheat Device session is over) at the start of the level. It still follows your movement, though.
Cheat338="Level Codes\Sewers of Imperial City\New Camera Angle #2",811A7610 42C8
Cheat338_N=Same as New Camera Angle, but the second camera angle is sleightly different.

Cheat341="Level Codes\Sewers of Imperial City\Strange Strafing",811A7634 42C8
Cheat341_N=Strafe to the left to make Dash go flying to the left (through walls, too), while strafing to the right if you want Dash to go flying to the right. Having a blaster fight with this code is cool, because it sometimes looks as if Dash's shots go out and then hit you (also happens if you shoot a wall on occasion). This code crashes after a while, but doesn't do any damage to your Cheat Device or game.
Cheat342="Level Codes\Sewers of Imperial City\Dash Codes\Cosmic Dash",811A7622 42C8
Cheat342_N=Try jumping a few times (or try keeping the button down after you have pressed it) to see Dash defy gravity sleightly and not fall down immediately.
Cheat343="Level Codes\Sewers of Imperial City\Dash Codes\Dancing Dash",811A7624 42C8
Cheat343_N=To see Dash dance, merely push to the left or right of Dash, and continue for as long as you like.

Cheat347="Level Codes\Sewers of Imperial City\Have\All Items",811A7670 42C8
Cheat347_N=If you usually get somewhat close to an item or Challenge Point it automatically gives you it.
Cheat348="Level Codes\Sewers of Imperial City\Enemies Don't Attack You",811A7668 42C8
Cheat348_N=This messes with your camera angle a bit, so be prepared! I didn't test this against the boss, so I'm not sure if it attacks you or not (subtle hint for someone to e-mail me on this here..).
Cheat349="Level Codes\Sewers of Imperial City\Dash Codes\Sick Dash",811A7694 42C8
Cheat349_N=Wait about 10-20 seconds for Dash to suddenly move forward as if he was sick.

Cheat350="Level Codes\Sewers of Imperial City\Clipping Mode",811A7682 42C8
Cheat350_N=Note: Either you can walk straight through the walls, or adjust the camera to it's farthest distance from Dash (behind him), and you should see beyond the walls. I then after that tried switching back to my original view, and Dash was through the wall!
Cheat351="Level Codes\Xizor's Palace\Dash Codes\Back-Flipping Dash",811A5578 42C8
Cheat351_N=Turn on your Jetpack to see Dash do a cool maneuver. Also try going to the top of the ceiling and watch the camera angle change!

Cheat117_N=Turn this code on before the title screen. I have tested the PAL code on a real N64 but to get the PAL and NTSC code to work with Project64 you have to split the code in half and activate both parts. To do that, add a new cheat and copy half the code into it and then copy the bottom half into another new cheat; turn both halves on as if they were a single cheat (I have divided the codes for you); Whenever the game is not paused. use the D-pad left and right buttons to alter the GID value (in hex) which is the graphic ID, i.e., what the object to spawn should look like. To modify the behaviour value (in hex)-shown as BHV (BHR in NTSC version as there's no colourful V character)-use the D-pad up and down, and then press the shoulder left button to spawn the object at Mario's position (the code is very sensitive so it's likely that many objects will be created with a single press). Make sure you select the right values otherwise the game may crash-see Super Mario 64 Exposed section about SM64 for values to use (you don't need the 1300); if you spawn too many objects the game will freeze; Due to the way the code works, Mario's health will not update as it should making him invincible. Do not press other buttons with the D-pad or shoulder L button otherwise the code will not work. You can only spawn one type of an object, for e.g., you can't choose what type of Koopa to spawn.

Cheat118="Mundo\Nearly All Graphics Are Missing",A032B704 000F

Cheat120="Miscellaneous Codes\Partial See-Through-Walls Effect",A032C222 2222
Cheat120_N=I think this code messes up the order of polygons in the Z-buffer. The value 2222 causes polygons to overlap, producing dithered pixels that look a little bit like Mario's invisi-cap. Changing it even by one will change the effect to one where whole polygons flicker, and changing it too much will eliminate the effect.

Cheat173_N=Notes; *If using in PJ64, Enable codes then reset the game with the codes still on. This makes PJ64 refresh the ASM and the code will actually work; *By default, extra stars are only counted after you get 120 normal ones. This can be altered by changing this line: 8127A0A6 0078. 0078 is 120, 0000 will make it work all the time, etc.; *This works for all 4 save games. The only downside is that you have no Rainbow Ride coins record. This replaces that. Before you ask, getting coins in that level doesn't mess up the count; *The only known issue is the Castle Secret Stars disaply on the pause menu while you're in the castle. Part 2 is the fix for this, if you don't mind the extra lines; *Maximum is 255 EXTRA stars. This is because we're using an 8-bit coin record for our counter. Total stars you can get with this code would be 375. Although, you could see some more if you used the 175 stars code on the site, which gives you a bunch of Castle Secret Stars that didn't actually exist.; *If you want to reset your extra star counter, use one of the following codes and press the Cheat Device Button; File 1: 88207733 0000; File 2: 882077A3 0000; File 3: 88207813 0000; File 4: 88207883 0000

There's a maximum value for when you're making mario run, and an absolute maximum simply for when Mario is on the ground. All this does is bump up the overall maximum speed and make it so that instead of being limited to a speed of 32 by subtracting one when it reaches 32, it adds one instead.

Cheat370_N=This code will change all Goombas' heads to that of Peach's head in Bob-omb Battlefield by using my Press L to copy memory code. If you are using an emulator you must have the expansion pack enabled (for Project64 after loading the game ROM, go to Options->Settings and click on the Rom Settings tab. Then click on the Memory Size drop-down arrow and select 8MB and click Ok). It will also work on a real N64 but I have only tested with the Equalizer cheat code cartridge-do not do any searches with the cheat code cartridge when using this code. While outside the castle, press the shoulder L button which will copy Peach and other graphics to the expansion pack. Then go to Bob-omb Battlefield (works for most stars) and when you are in the level, press D-pad up so that the Goombas have the head of Peach. Note that when using this code the game may glitch up or even crash due to the complications of how the game handles the graphics. Thanks to Yoshielectron

Cheat372_N=Using this code, whenever the shoulder L button is pressed, the game will slow down (it works for most places but doesn't affect everything). To slow down the game down more or less you need to alter the last four values at the end of the 2nd and 4th code lines, which together form the hex value 00100000. Higher values will slow down the game more, lower values not so much. Thanks to Yoshielectron

Cheat374_N=Using this code you can copy memory (RAM) from one place to another, which can be used for many things. The last three groups of two code lines set the source start, source end, and destination start address of the data to copy (I've separated them to make them more clear but you can still use the whole thing as one code, or add the last parts as separate codes in addition to the first part). To use the example values, turn on the code and go to Bob-omb Battlefield, select the first star (it will have a different effect in other courses/stars) and press the shoulder L button to change the Bob-omb buddy's graphics to that of King Bob-omb.

Cheat378_N=Turn this code on before the title screen appears; the code is split into two which you will need to add as two separate codes but activate as if they were the one cheat. Then, whenever the game is not paused you will be able to view and edit the memory (RAM). The address is displayed on the left, and the byte stored there on the right; These are the controls: D-pad up/down go to next/previous address; D-pad right/left go to +0x100/-0x100 address; Shoulder L and right/left increase/decrease the byte; Shoulder L and up/down go to +0x00100000/-0x00100000 address; Do not go below address 0x80000000 or above 0x803FFFFF otherwise the game may crash. As an added bonus, when you use this code you can directly change the size modifiers in the Mario object allowing you to make Mario more Luigi or Wario's size, for example. Thanks to Yoshielectron

Cheat398_N=Activate this code before the title screen appears and when you start outside the castle the camera will be at a different view. To put the camera on the next object use D-pad up, or on the previous object by pressing D-pad down; the object number (ON) will be displayed. If the object number goes below zero or over EF the game may crash (as there are only 240 objects in any level); Here are some values to use: Castle grounds 54=overhead at start; 60=Mario; 5B=drain under water; 5F on the way to the castle. Inside castle 3C=Mario; 26=overhead. Bob-omb Battlefield star 2 13=a Goomba; 43= a Bob-omb; 80=Mario; 71=Koopa the Quick. Castle basement 1A=Mario. Thanks to Yoshielectron

Cheat402_N=This code changes the colour of the dust from Mario and other objects to red. The colour values are the last 4 digits on the end of each code line with RRGG (red and green) on each odd line and BBAA (blue and alpha) on each even line. Alpha controls the transparency; use values from 00 for completely transparent to FF for not at all transparent. There are 4 colour values in total (each two code lines is one colour) that are normally all the same colour but by using different colours you can create a multi-colour effect.

Cheat404_N=This code compliments the 'Change Mario to 1 of 5 different sizes' code. It uses the D-pad to change mario's colour to Luigi, Waluigi, Wario and the normal Mario colour. May not work as well on a real N64. Thanks to YouTube user Mon732

Cheat405_N=This code changes the colour of the sparkles from objects such as a Koopa shell to black. Each group of four values at the end of each code line controls the colour of the sparkles in the format RRGGBBAA (red, green, blue and alpha), split onto two lines. So in this code the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th code lines control and the RRGG colour values and are 0000. The 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th code lines control the BBAA values and are 00FF. Alpha determines how transparent the sparkles are, use higher values for less transparent so, for example, 40 is transparent but FF is not at all transparent (transparency should work on a real N64 as well as emulators). Please note that although there are four colour values for the sparkles, it only works well if you use just two different colour values, duplicated. Thanks to Yoshielectron

Cheat416_N=This code colours the yellow coins red, green, blue and yellow. The first two code lines colour the yellow coin's bottom left corner, the next two code lines colour the bottom right corner, then the next two code lines colour the top right corner and lastly the last two code lines colour the top left corner. The format is red, green, blue, alpha with values in hex ranging from 00 to FF. For example, in the first two code lines the bottom left corner is coloured red because the values are FF0000FF (RGBA); Alpha controls how transparent the colour is (does not work well on a real N64 and only works on some emulators), with FF for completely opaque and lower values for more transparent. Note that if you use different amounts of transparency for the corners the coin may not appear that transparent, i.e. all corners should have the same amount of transparency; It is best that this code is turned on after the file select screen.

Each item will be placed in front of Mario so the second player can help out or make things worse; Note: due to how the NTSC game is programmed, the NTSC version of this code is slightly longer than the PAL code.

Note: Before pressing a D-pad direction or the shoulder L button only the object number will be shown; The PAL version has less debug information. The NTSC version has more missing colourful characters so the debug will be harder to read. The Japanese versions have all the colourful characters so the debug looks as it should.

Cheat465_N=When in Bob-omb Battlefield, press the L button to give Mario a Goomba head. However, Mario's head will show at certain times such as when the camera zoom changes or when using a cap item. warning: after pressing L do not go to any other course even if you turn the code off; if you're using an emulator stop emulation and then load the ROM again or if you are using a real N64, power off and then on again to make sure the code no longer has an effect; This code will work in other places such as outside the castle, but you must go there first before pressing the L button.

Cheat471_N=Turn this code on at the file select screen. This code removes Mario's arms and legs (but he still has his hands and feet) so he looks like Rayman. Note that to as to keep the code as short as possible, for some cap powers Mario or the cap won't look right and, Mario's arms and legs will show when the camera is far from Mario.

Cheat474_N=Turn this code on when you start outside the castle, it will replace Mario's hands with Starmans and works for all courses. If you use the metal or vanish cap the Starmans will be gone until the cap power runs out-this also happens when warping and when putting on Mario's cap.

Cheat477_N=I, like many others, discovered the Yoshi egg texture in Wet-dry world but by using an existing object and animating it, the effect looks almost like a hatching egg. Go to Wet-Dry World, select star 1 and when in the level switch the code on; you will find the Yoshi egg where the large float would be higher up from where you start (but it's still a float).

This code also changes his Gloves to a dark brown color, and his hair yellow. It also makes him skinnier and bigger, so it's even more like Link.

Cheat486_N=Turn this code on before the file select screen and then, after picking a save file you will see Peach where you start outside the castle instead of the signpost. You can then press the D-pad and the L button to change Peach's animations. You can press any of the buttons again to replay the animation even halfway through the same animation. Please note that depending on the type of animation, the next one(s) will also be played in sequence. Also, at the start Peach will begin with a default animation where she walks away (but changing her animation will bring her back). And, you can still read the 'signpost' I should mention; My Thanks go to YouTube user Marksmithwas12 who tested a beta version of this code. Thanks to Yoshielectron

In the Bowser fight levels, Bowser will start off and stay transparent, except in the second Bowser fight level after the first time Bowser teleports he will only be transparent when teleporting again. The end value (80) is how transparent Bowser is; use lower values for more transparent and higher values (up to FF) for less transparent; Note: in the NTSC version Bowser may flicker due to the differences in programming.

Cheat493_N=Using any of the D-pad directions you can display one of the messages that you normally come across in the game. Use D-pad up for the Koopa shell introduction, D-pad down for the hallway message, D-pad left for castle introduction and D-pad right for the key doesn't fit message; Note that while the message is displayed you can still move Mario but jumping, etc, will move onto the next part of the message if there is more to be displayed. Going to another level is another way to stop displaying the message; The end value on each even code line (0010, 0013, 0021 and 0017) is which message to display for each D-pad direction; 0000 is the first message, 0001 is the second message, and so on.

Cheat505_N=When you are inside the castle, go into the area with the trapdoors that would drop Mario to the first Bowser level, but walk up to just before the trapdoors (if you go to either side of the walls you can look around with C-up to see where the trapdoors are). Then press the shoulder L button and Mario will be placed past the trapdoors where the Bowser/Peach painting is. Note that the painting is just for show and doesn't lead you any where.

Cheat51_N=This version doesn't screw up when you fall from a high place. I know at one point in the game after you get a certain star, Mario falls from somewhere, and with the old code it'd make him jump in midair and you wouldn't get credit for the star.

Cheat523_N=Go to Star 3 of the Bob-omb Battlefield level and turn on the code for your version of the game; the pink Bob-omb will become an enemy! This is a good example of keeping an object's graphics the same but by changing its behaviour pointers so it will act differently. Thanks to Yoshielectron

Cheat524_N=In the video I uploaded to YouTube I had moved a door so that it was between the mirror, alowing Mario to just walk through it. However, the doors move about in memory, making it hard to create a code; But there is a much easier way to go past the mirror by modifying Mario's coordinates which is exactly what this code does. To get it working, go up the stairs in the castle, into the mirror room and place Mario against the mirror-press L and he will go past the mirror; You can have this code on even before starting the game.

Cheat117_N=Turn this code on before the title screen. I have tested the PAL code on a real N64 but to get the PAL and NTSC code to work with Project64 you have to split the code in half and activate both parts. To do that, add a new cheat and copy half the code into it and then copy the bottom half into another new cheat; turn both halves on as if they were a single cheat (I have divided the codes for you); Whenever the game is not paused. use the D-pad left and right buttons to alter the GID value (in hex) which is the graphic ID, i.e., what the object to spawn should look like. To modify the behaviour value (in hex)-shown as BHV (BHR in NTSC version as there's no colourful V character)-use the D-pad up and down, and then press the shoulder left button to spawn the object at Mario's position (the code is very sensitive so it's likely that many objects will be created with a single press). Make sure you select the right values otherwise the game may crash-see Super Mario 64 Exposed section about SM64 for values to use (you don't need the 1300); if you spawn too many objects the game will freeze; Due to the way the code works, Mario's health will not update as it should making him invincible. Do not press other buttons with the D-pad or shoulder L button otherwise the code will not work. You can only spawn one type of an object, for e.g., you can't choose what type of Koopa to spawn.

Cheat118="Mundo\Nearly All Graphics Are Missing",A032B704 000F
Cheat118_N=Unlike the "No Surroundings" code, this code eliminates practically all the graphical elements, including the "TM" and copyright statement, the background of the intro screen, and most of the Select File screen.

Cheat120="Miscellaneous Codes\Partial See-Through-Walls Effect",A032C222 2222
Cheat120_N=I think this code messes up the order of polygons in the Z-buffer. The value 2222 causes polygons to overlap, producing dithered pixels that look a little bit like Mario's invisi-cap. Changing it even by one will change the effect to one where whole polygons flicker, and changing it too much will eliminate the effect.

Cheat173_N=Notes; *If using in PJ64, Enable codes then reset the game with the codes still on. This makes PJ64 refresh the ASM and the code will actually work; *By default, extra stars are only counted after you get 120 normal ones. This can be altered by changing this line: 8127A0A6 0078. 0078 is 120, 0000 will make it work all the time, etc.; *This works for all 4 save games. The only downside is that you have no Rainbow Ride coins record. This replaces that. Before you ask, getting coins in that level doesn't mess up the count; *The only known issue is the Castle Secret Stars disaply on the pause menu while you're in the castle. Part 2 is the fix for this, if you don't mind the extra lines; *Maximum is 255 EXTRA stars. This is because we're using an 8-bit coin record for our counter. Total stars you can get with this code would be 375. Although, you could see some more if you used the 175 stars code on the site, which gives you a bunch of Castle Secret Stars that didn't actually exist.; *If you want to reset your extra star counter, use one of the following codes and press the Cheat Device Button; File 1: 88207733 0000; File 2: 882077A3 0000; File 3: 88207813 0000; File 4: 88207883 0000

There's a maximum value for when you're making mario run, and an absolute maximum simply for when Mario is on the ground. All this does is bump up the overall maximum speed and make it so that instead of being limited to a speed of 32 by subtracting one when it reaches 32, it adds one instead.

Cheat370_N=This code will change all Goombas' heads to that of Peach's head in Bob-omb Battlefield by using my Press L to copy memory code. If you are using an emulator you must have the expansion pack enabled (for Project64 after loading the game ROM, go to Options->Settings and click on the Rom Settings tab. Then click on the Memory Size drop-down arrow and select 8MB and click Ok). It will also work on a real N64 but I have only tested with the Equalizer cheat code cartridge-do not do any searches with the cheat code cartridge when using this code. While outside the castle, press the shoulder L button which will copy Peach and other graphics to the expansion pack. Then go to Bob-omb Battlefield (works for most stars) and when you are in the level, press D-pad up so that the Goombas have the head of Peach. Note that when using this code the game may glitch up or even crash due to the complications of how the game handles the graphics. Thanks to Yoshielectron

Cheat372_N=Using this code, whenever the shoulder L button is pressed, the game will slow down (it works for most places but doesn't affect everything). To slow down the game down more or less you need to alter the last four values at the end of the 2nd and 4th code lines, which together form the hex value 00100000. Higher values will slow down the game more, lower values not so much. Thanks to Yoshielectron

Cheat374_N=Using this code you can copy memory (RAM) from one place to another, which can be used for many things. The last three groups of two code lines set the source start, source end, and destination start address of the data to copy (I've separated them to make them more clear but you can still use the whole thing as one code, or add the last parts as separate codes in addition to the first part). To use the example values, turn on the code and go to Bob-omb Battlefield, select the first star (it will have a different effect in other courses/stars) and press the shoulder L button to change the Bob-omb buddy's graphics to that of King Bob-omb.

Cheat375_N=Whenever the game is not paused, and at other times, the game will be in window mode, the border colour will change from bright red when Mario has full health to dark red when he is dead; Note: the NTSC game has a black border at the top and bottom of the screen that is fixed and unaffected by this code.

Cheat378_N=Turn this code on before the title screen appears; the code is split into two which you will need to add as two separate codes but activate as if they were the one cheat. Then, whenever the game is not paused you will be able to view and edit the memory (RAM). The address is displayed on the left, and the byte stored there on the right; These are the controls: D-pad up/down go to next/previous address; D-pad right/left go to +0x100/-0x100 address; Shoulder L and right/left increase/decrease the byte; Shoulder L and up/down go to +0x00100000/-0x00100000 address; Do not go below address 0x80000000 or above 0x803FFFFF otherwise the game may crash. As an added bonus, when you use this code you can directly change the size modifiers in the Mario object allowing you to make Mario more Luigi or Wario's size, for example. Thanks to Yoshielectron

Cheat398_N=Activate this code before the title screen appears and when you start outside the castle the camera will be at a different view. To put the camera on the next object use D-pad up, or on the previous object by pressing D-pad down; the object number (ON) will be displayed. If the object number goes below zero or over EF the game may crash (as there are only 240 objects in any level); Here are some values to use: Castle grounds 54=overhead at start; 60=Mario; 5B=drain under water; 5F on the way to the castle. Inside castle 3C=Mario; 26=overhead. Bob-omb Battlefield star 2 13=a Goomba; 43= a Bob-omb; 80=Mario; 71=Koopa the Quick. Castle basement 1A=Mario. Thanks to Yoshielectron

Cheat402_N=This code changes the colour of the dust from Mario and other objects to red. The colour values are the last 4 digits on the end of each code line with RRGG (red and green) on each odd line and BBAA (blue and alpha) on each even line. Alpha controls the transparency; use values from 00 for completely transparent to FF for not at all transparent. There are 4 colour values in total (each two code lines is one colour) that are normally all the same colour but by using different colours you can create a multi-colour effect.

Cheat404_N=This code compliments the 'Change Mario to 1 of 5 different sizes' code. It uses the D-pad to change mario's colour to Luigi, Waluigi, Wario and the normal Mario colour. May not work as well on a real N64. Thanks to YouTube user Mon732

Cheat405_N=This code changes the colour of the sparkles from objects such as a Koopa shell to black. Each group of four values at the end of each code line controls the colour of the sparkles in the format RRGGBBAA (red, green, blue and alpha), split onto two lines. So in this code the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th code lines control and the RRGG colour values and are 0000. The 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th code lines control the BBAA values and are 00FF. Alpha determines how transparent the sparkles are, use higher values for less transparent so, for example, 40 is transparent but FF is not at all transparent (transparency should work on a real N64 as well as emulators). Please note that although there are four colour values for the sparkles, it only works well if you use just two different colour values, duplicated. Thanks to Yoshielectron

Cheat416_N=This code colours the yellow coins red, green, blue and yellow. The first two code lines colour the yellow coin's bottom left corner, the next two code lines colour the bottom right corner, then the next two code lines colour the top right corner and lastly the last two code lines colour the top left corner. The format is red, green, blue, alpha with values in hex ranging from 00 to FF. For example, in the first two code lines the bottom left corner is coloured red because the values are FF0000FF (RGBA); Alpha controls how transparent the colour is (does not work well on a real N64 and only works on some emulators), with FF for completely opaque and lower values for more transparent. Note that if you use different amounts of transparency for the corners the coin may not appear that transparent, i.e. all corners should have the same amount of transparency; It is best that this code is turned on after the file select screen.

Each item will be placed in front of Mario so the second player can help out or make things worse; Note: due to how the NTSC game is programmed, the NTSC version of this code is slightly longer than the PAL code.

Note: Before pressing a D-pad direction or the shoulder L button only the object number will be shown; The PAL version has less debug information. The NTSC version has more missing colourful characters so the debug will be harder to read. The Japanese versions have all the colourful characters so the debug looks as it should.

Cheat465_N=When in Bob-omb Battlefield, press the L button to give Mario a Goomba head. However, Mario's head will show at certain times such as when the camera zoom changes or when using a cap item. warning: after pressing L do not go to any other course even if you turn the code off; if you're using an emulator stop emulation and then load the ROM again or if you are using a real N64, power off and then on again to make sure the code no longer has an effect; This code will work in other places such as outside the castle, but you must go there first before pressing the L button.

Cheat471_N=Turn this code on at the file select screen. This code removes Mario's arms and legs (but he still has his hands and feet) so he looks like Rayman. Note that to as to keep the code as short as possible, for some cap powers Mario or the cap won't look right and, Mario's arms and legs will show when the camera is far from Mario.

Cheat474_N=Turn this code on when you start outside the castle, it will replace Mario's hands with Starmans and works for all courses. If you use the metal or vanish cap the Starmans will be gone until the cap power runs out-this also happens when warping and when putting on Mario's cap.

Cheat477_N=I, like many others, discovered the Yoshi egg texture in Wet-dry world but by using an existing object and animating it, the effect looks almost like a hatching egg. Go to Wet-Dry World, select star 1 and when in the level switch the code on; you will find the Yoshi egg where the large float would be higher up from where you start (but it's still a float).

This code also changes his Gloves to a dark brown color, and his hair yellow. It also makes him skinnier and bigger, so it's even more like Link.

Cheat486_N=Turn this code on before the file select screen and then, after picking a save file you will see Peach where you start outside the castle instead of the signpost. You can then press the D-pad and the L button to change Peach's animations. You can press any of the buttons again to replay the animation even halfway through the same animation. Please note that depending on the type of animation, the next one(s) will also be played in sequence. Also, at the start Peach will begin with a default animation where she walks away (but changing her animation will bring her back). And, you can still read the 'signpost' I should mention; My Thanks go to YouTube user Marksmithwas12 who tested a beta version of this code. Thanks to Yoshielectron

In the Bowser fight levels, Bowser will start off and stay transparent, except in the second Bowser fight level after the first time Bowser teleports he will only be transparent when teleporting again. The end value (80) is how transparent Bowser is; use lower values for more transparent and higher values (up to FF) for less transparent; Note: in the NTSC version Bowser may flicker due to the differences in programming.

Cheat493_N=Using any of the D-pad directions you can display one of the messages that you normally come across in the game. Use D-pad up for the Koopa shell introduction, D-pad down for the hallway message, D-pad left for castle introduction and D-pad right for the key doesn't fit message; Note that while the message is displayed you can still move Mario but jumping, etc, will move onto the next part of the message if there is more to be displayed. Going to another level is another way to stop displaying the message; The end value on each even code line (0010, 0013, 0021 and 0017) is which message to display for each D-pad direction; 0000 is the first message, 0001 is the second message, and so on.

Cheat505_N=When you are inside the castle, go into the area with the trapdoors that would drop Mario to the first Bowser level, but walk up to just before the trapdoors (if you go to either side of the walls you can look around with C-up to see where the trapdoors are). Then press the shoulder L button and Mario will be placed past the trapdoors where the Bowser/Peach painting is. Note that the painting is just for show and doesn't lead you any where.

Cheat51_N=This version doesn't screw up when you fall from a high place. I know at one point in the game after you get a certain star, Mario falls from somewhere, and with the old code it'd make him jump in midair and you wouldn't get credit for the star.

Cheat523_N=Go to Star 3 of the Bob-omb Battlefield level and turn on the code for your version of the game; the pink Bob-omb will become an enemy! This is a good example of keeping an object's graphics the same but by changing its behaviour pointers so it will act differently. Thanks to Yoshielectron

Cheat524_N=In the video I uploaded to YouTube I had moved a door so that it was between the mirror, alowing Mario to just walk through it. However, the doors move about in memory, making it hard to create a code; But there is a much easier way to go past the mirror by modifying Mario's coordinates which is exactly what this code does. To get it working, go up the stairs in the castle, into the mirror room and place Mario against the mirror-press L and he will go past the mirror; You can have this code on even before starting the game.

Cheat7_N=Default Value - 3F4C, Best Value Range - 3E4C - 404C. Now there are two problems with this code: 1. Some levels actually do change Yoshi's size, like Level 4-3 (Piranha Grove). Other levels just change the size of other objects. Other than Level 4-3, I haven't tested what other levels allow Yoshi to change size. I'm still looking for that "all-the-time" code, as some people might call it. 2. Yoshi (or another object; a Shyguy would be an example) is not touching the ground. For example, if you made Yoshi tiny, he would be floating an inch or two above the ground, but if he's big, it will look like he's standing in some type of foreground (well, you get the idea)

Cheat62_N=If you go to an area where Link is immobile or invisible, using the "appear in strange places" code will almost always fix it, but you'll start somewhere outside of the Arena and in air. I recommend using the infinite step Hover boots code already supplied with PJ64 so you can float back into the arena in the event that this happens.

Cheat63_N=If you go to an area where the interface is accessible, this signigfies that you're not in 'beta' mode anymore. Using the "interface always off/on" code, you can stay in 'beta' mode regardless of what happens. This may cause more crashes in SOME areas, but it's rare and is not too severe. If you need to explore a beta area with the interface, "use the interface always on" portion of the code. Don't use the codes as you start the game. If you need the interface on/off at a specific time, start the game, go to the area, activate the code, keep it on until next reset.

Cheat62_N=If you go to an area where Link is immobile or invisible, using the "appear in strange places" code will almost always fix it, but you'll start somewhere outside of the Arena and in air.

Using the "interface always off/on" code, you can stay in 'beta' mode regardless of what happens. This may cause more crashes in SOME areas, but it's rare and is not too severe. If you need to explore a beta area with the interface, "use the interface always on" portion of the code. Don't use the codes as you start the game. If you need the interface on/off at a specific time, start the game, go to the area, activate the code, keep it on until next reset.

Cheat26="Beta Bottles Revenge Mode",80130402 0001,8008B4D1 0002
Cheat26_N=Bottles Revenge is a Beta mode from Banjo Tooie that the RWP team recently uncovered after an extraordinary amount of effort. Bottles the Spirit transforms into Bottles the Devil and posses enemies nearby and allows a second player hooked up to Pad 2 to play as that Posses character to try to foil Banjos Plans. As player one goes about its business, player two uses every enemy nearby to try to nab Banjo and take away some life. This mode is incredible, and you can control almost every enemy in the game: slot machines, flying creatures, uggers, zubbas...and this is just the beginning. (Congrats Rare Witch Project)

Cheat61="Beta\Appear in Strange Places (Hold R)",D01C64F5 0010,81119736 0001
Cheat61_N=If you go to an area where Link is immobile or invisible, using the "appear in strange places" code will almost always fix it, but you'll start somewhere outside of the Arena and in air. I recommend using the infinite step Hover boots code already supplied with PJ64 so you can float back into the arena in the event that this happens.
Cheat62="Beta\Interface always off/on",801192B9 00FF,8011972F 00??
Cheat62_N=If you go to an area where the interface is accessible, this signigfies that you're not in 'beta' mode anymore. Using the "interface always off/on" code, you can stay in 'beta' mode regardless of what happens. This may cause more crashes in SOME areas, but it's rare and is not too severe. If you need to explore a beta area with the interface, "use the interface always on" portion of the code. Don't use the codes as you start the game. If you need the interface on/off at a specific time, start the game, go to the area, activate the code, keep it on until next reset.

Cheat61="Beta\Appear in Strange Places (Hold R)",D01C6535 0010,81119776 0001
Cheat61_N=If you go to an area where Link is immobile or invisible, using the "appear in strange places" code will almost always fix it, but you'll start somewhere outside of the Arena and in air. I recommend using the infinite step Hover boots code already supplied with PJ64 so you can float back into the arena in the event that this happens.
Cheat62="Beta\Interface always off/on",801192F9 00FF,8011976F 00??
Cheat62_N=If you go to an area where the interface is accessible, this signigfies that you're not in 'beta' mode anymore. Using the "interface always off/on" code, you can stay in 'beta' mode regardless of what happens. This may cause more crashes in SOME areas, but it's rare and is not too severe. If you need to explore a beta area with the interface, "use the interface always on" portion of the code. Don't use the codes as you start the game. If you need the interface on/off at a specific time, start the game, go to the area, activate the code, keep it on until next reset.

Cheat61_N=If you go to an area where Link is immobile or invisible, using the "appear in strange places" code will almost always fix it, but you'll start somewhere outside of the Arena and in air.

Cheat62_O=$00 Off,$01 Off
Cheat62_N=If you go to an area where the interface is accessible, this signigfies that you're not in 'beta' mode anymore. Using the "interface always off/on" code, you can stay in 'beta' mode regardless of what happens. This may cause more crashes in SOME areas, but it's rare and is not too severe. If you need to explore a beta area with the interface, "use the interface always on" portion of the code. Don't use the codes as you start the game. If you need the interface on/off at a specific time, start the game, go to the area, activate the code, keep it on until next reset.

Cheat62="Beta\Appear in Strange Places (Hold R)",D01C681D 0010,81119C9E 0001
Cheat62_N=If you go to an area where Link is immobile or invisible, using the "appear in strange places" code will almost always fix it, but you'll start somewhere outside of the Arena and in air. I recommend using the infinite step Hover boots code already supplied with PJ64 so you can float back into the arena in the event that this happens.
Cheat63="Beta\Interface always off/on",80119821 00FF,80119C97 00??
Cheat63_N=If you go to an area where the interface is accessible, this signigfies that you're not in 'beta' mode anymore. Using the "interface always off/on" code, you can stay in 'beta' mode regardless of what happens. This may cause more crashes in SOME areas, but it's rare and is not too severe. If you need to explore a beta area with the interface, "use the interface always on" portion of the code. Don't use the codes as you start the game. If you need the interface on/off at a specific time, start the game, go to the area, activate the code, keep it on until next reset.

Cheat26="Beta Bottles Revenge Mode",80130172 0001,8008B4D1 0002
Cheat26_N=Bottles Revenge is a Beta mode from Banjo Tooie that the RWP team recently uncovered after an extraordinary amount of effort. Bottles the Spirit transforms into Bottles the Devil and posses enemies nearby and allows a second player hooked up to Pad 2 to play as that Posses character to try to foil Banjos Plans. As player one goes about its business, player two uses every enemy nearby to try to nab Banjo and take away some life. This mode is incredible, and you can control almost every enemy in the game: slot machines, flying creatures, uggers, zubbas...and this is just the beginning. (Congrats Rare Witch Project)

Cheat5_N=Push Left (on Control Pad) to activate it, Right (on Control Pad) to deactivate. This WTW kind of sucks for one reason, you will be forced downwards at a slow rate, you can however, jump a few times to get back to the ground, or keep jumping to get to higher places. If you deactivate the code while on the other side of a wall, you will fall until you die, so it's good to keep it active. Also, the game will set it back to normal when you walk through a door, or enter a level. Thanks to Kong K. Rool

Cheat177="Alter Tracks\Track Enhancer Hard",8109E22F 30C5
Cheat177_N=There Are Bumps/Jumps/Holes In Tracks. Be very careful! There are invisible holes on the tracks, (mainly on corners and crazy amounts of bumps) and there are bumps try to avoid or slow down.
Cheat178="Alter Tracks\Track Cofuser",8109EACF 30C5
Cheat178_N=The track is there but parts of the track are turned sideways. If you know were the track is supposed to be then you'll be fine.
Cheat179="Miscellanious Codes\Finish Camera In Time Trials",880CD003 0002
Cheat179_N=Steps to getting the demo mode in time trial: 1. Make sure 2 controllers are connected. 2. Play game and go to Grand Prix/Practice 3. Press the Cheat Device Button in the car select menu. A secound car will be active. Use the 2nd controller to select it. 4. Enter race/then quit race. 5. Go to Time Trial, select your car and track, and then enter the race. Press F9 before countdown starts.

Cheat181_N=Two players can play in a cup OR two players can play in Death Races. Just select and play. To select any level for Death Race, simply finish the original Death Race and then select change course. All courses are playable.
Cheat182="Alter Tracks\Track Changer 1",8109E5A4 30C5
Cheat182_N=This code adds twists/turns to existing twist/turns/loops (Mute City's loop is now corkscrewed). For some tracks, you may have to start then select retry because you go through the track the first time. The starting points are changed a bit, and the starting grid is bigger/smaller. Some tracks have a flip point (Silence 1) that won't let you drive the whole track. In some cases it may freeze. The best method to tackling the loop twists is to slow down and hold up!
Cheat183="Alter Tracks\Track Changer 2",8109E5A8 30C5
Cheat183_N=See the note for the first track changer for additional details. The cars won't fall through the track, and twists or turns are different. In Sector A, there is an inverted loop/corkscrew! That may look impossible to drive on, but just drive carefully. This code seems to be more crash-prone than the previous code, especially on Red Canyon 1. Silence is still the only track with a flip point that you can't drive through. Rainbow Road is awesome, with the bombs gathered together!

Cheat212_N=This code is good if you don't want to slide at all, but since you can't slide, the 'Z'+'R' buttons will lock the cars direction. Be careful! If you hit a wall, you'll probably be stuck on it longer. Just hit the 'A' button to get off the wall faster. Setting it all the way to acceleration won't matter you still won't slide at all.
