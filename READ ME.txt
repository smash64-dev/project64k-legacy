Brief Netplay Tutorial 

1) Place N64 Roms inside of the Roms folder and Run Auto-Setup reg file, or go to File, Choose rom directory, and choose your rom folder location.

2) If the roms do not automatically load, go to File, Refresh Rom List (or press F5). This is so you can use the roms over kaillera.

3) Go to File, Start Netplay, then enter a username, find a server and connect.

4) Right-Click the game list or click the "CRT" or "Create" button if it appears.

5) To enable Gameshark cheats go to System, Gameshark Codes, then Enable the cheats you want.
	Note: You may want to Disable then Re-enable cheat codes to make sure they are sent to the other player.
		(for the most part the cheats should be saved in cache and sent without manual uncheck/checking)

1) If you're playing against someone with a Ralphnet adaptor you'll need to have RAW DATA checked. This option is present in Nrage plugins. 
Options > Config Controller > Check the checkbox under RAW data. 

2) If the person you're playing doesn't have Counter Factor set to 1, then they will DS. Advice them to redownload the emulator from www.PJ64k.blogspot.com or switch the CF.
Emulate the rom > Options > Settings > Rom Settings > Counter Factor: 1

Project64k can only sync a few games over Kaillera (Currently Emulinker X v2.x)

Known games to sync over Emulinker X 2.x servers are

~ SSB64 (Super Smash Bros 64, all versions work, Japanese version has Graphics issues with Jabo Direct3D6 and 7, Random stage causes DS)
~ Mario Kart 64 (Core emulation bug, 3-4 players cause inproper game speeds)
~ Star Fox 64 (Works fine with stable connections, desyncs with lag)
~ Super Mario 64 Multiplayer (Any Rom Hack made multiplayer will probably be better with Mupen64k since it supports saving game data used online)
Few other games work in sync over Kaillera with PJ64K 1.4. 

Every other game such as Mario Party, Cronker's Bad Fur Day, Goldeneye 007 will desync over Kaillera with PJ64k so you will need to use Mupen64K(renamed Mupen64++).
